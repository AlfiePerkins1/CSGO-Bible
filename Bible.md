# Introduction

## What is CSGO

- Counter-Strike(CS) Global Offensive(CSGO) is the latest game in the Counter-Strike series produced by Valve it follows on from CS Source and before that CS 1.6

## Rules

- The rules of CSGO vary depending on what gamemode] is being played, however the following basic rules apply
  - 

## Game modes

- CSGO has 9 official gamemodes [Reference](https://www.metabomb.net/csgo/gameplay-guides/csgo-game-modes-guide "Reference"):


  - Competitive 
    - The mode played in proffesional CSGO, this the mode people first think of when thinking about CSGO as it is the gamemode that gives players ranks
    - This is the only mode that affects your Competitive rank
    - Two teams of 5 players in a MR30 (*maxround 30, I.E the first team to 16 rounds wins and the game is tied at 15-15*)
    - After 15 rounds (half way through), both teams switch side (T -> CT, CT -> T)
    - Each round lasts 1 minute 55 seconds, however this is reduced/increased to 40 seconds when the T's plant the bomb
    - In order for CT's to win the round they must either 
      1. Prevent the T's planting the bomb within the 1min55seconds
      2. Defuse the bomb after the T's have planted the bomb(*10seconds without a kit, 5 seconds with a kit*)
      3. Kill all T's before time expires
    - In order for the T's to win the round they must either
      1. Plant and exploded the bomb on either site(*A or B*)
      2. Kill all CT's before time expires
    - At the end of the game all players ranks in the game will become visible
    - All players must be Private Level 2 to play Competitive 
    - Friendly fire & collisions are enabled
    - Players can only spectate their teamates when they die


  - Casual
    - Similar to Competitive with minor changes
    - Team size becomes 10 player per team
    - Economy system changes in order to make a full buy possible each round to maximise play time
    - Collisions and friendly fire is disabled
    - The game ends after one team reaches 8 rounds
    - The number of grenades you can purchase is reduced 
    - Players can spectate **everyone** after they die
    - Casual games are losely based off your Competitive rank however not exactly


  - Deathmatch (DM)
    - Primary method of practicing & warming up (*other methods are more recommended, this will be discussed further on*) due to its high paced nature to help sharpen aiming skills
    - Can either be T or CT side, players can switch if a spot becomes available
    - Weapons are limited to their correct side (I.E AK on T side, M4 on CT side)
    - Each kill gives you points which moves you further up the in game leaderboard 
    - For a short period certain weapons grant bonus points, this is good for practicing with weapons you may rarely use. However it may lead to players using obselete weapons as well as weapons in incorrect scenarios
    - Respawns are quick and grant respawn immunity(can't be killed immediately as you spawn)
    - Spawns are in random locations spread across the map putting you into the action faster


  - Arms Race
    - Similar to Gun Game from Call of duty
    - Each player starts with a pistol and every 2 kills grants them an upgrade to a better gun 
    - The final stage is a golden knife, if the player reaches the golden knife and gets a kill with it they win the game
    - Quick respawns are enabled
    - The top players (Players who are closest to the golden knife) from each side glow through walls, adding an extra layer of difficulty 
    - Knifing someone (not with golden knife) will take them back to their previous gun
  - Demolition
  - Wingman
    - Similar to competitive however its 2v2 making it ideal to play with a friend
    - Operates with the MR16 setup
    - Each round lasts 1min 30seconds meaning games don't become too long
    - Wingman ranks are seperate from competitive ranks
  - Flying scoutsman
  - Retakes
  - Danger zone

## Ranking system
<!-- Unkown, win to rankup, list ranks, list percentages as of now, 10 wins to get a rank, cooldown after 2 wins unranked, different ranking for DZ, Wingman, Comp) -->

# Economy 

- The economy in CSGO is one of the most important aspects of the game, without good economical understanding you will be at a severe disadvantage. 
- As of 2021 each side starts with $800 at the beginning of each half and every player should always buy armour *unless in a team scenario but if you're reading this guide that's most likely not you*



## CT 

- Due to the nature of CSGO the CT's always tend to be in a worse economic situation than the T's due to the game favouring them when economy is even (T's have to push into the CT's)


### 	Pistol

- CT's start with $800 at the beginning of each half, typically you have 4/5 player purchase armour and 1 player purchasing a defuse kit. However most of the time 5 armoured CT's is much better.

## T

### Pistol

- T's also start with $800 at the beginning of each half, at low level all T's should purchase armour to mitigate aim punch when hit by a USP in the body, however it's not uncommon for one person to buy utility + P250 in order to help with pistol execs.

## Basic CT side strategies & setups

### Mirage

​	**Pistol**

  - Because Glocks are superior to the USP when up close and moving T's tend to rush/contact B therefore having 3 B on pistol round is standard, as well as 1 jiggle peeking mid and one playing retake on A(*CT/Triple or falling back to con from stairs*).

  - B site setup:

  - The aim is to stay as far away from the Glocks as possible, whilst playing headshot angles (*angles where only your head can be seen*)

  - Examples of good positions can be seen by the dots on the map of B site with the line of sight indicated by the red lines
