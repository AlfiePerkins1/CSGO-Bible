# Economy 

- The economy in CSGO is one of the most important aspects of the game, without good economical understanding you will be at a severe disadvantage. 
- As of 2021 each side starts with $800 at the beginning of each half and every player should always buy armour *unless in a team scenario but if you're reading this guide that's most likely not you*



## CT 

- Due to the nature of CSGO the CT's always tend to be in a worse economic situation than the T's due to the game favouring them when economy is even (T's have to push into the CT's)

### 	Pistol

- CT's start with $800 at the beginning of each half, typically you have 4/5 player purchase armour and 1 player purchasing a defuse kit. However most of the time 5 armoured CT's is much better.

## T

### Pistol

- T's also start with $800 at the beginning of each half, at low level all T's should purchase armour to mitigate aim punch when hit by a USP in the body, however it's not uncommon for one person to buy utility + P250 in order to help with pistol execs.

## Basic CT side strategies & setups

### Mirage

​	**Pistol**

    - Because Glocks are superior to the USP when up close and moving T's tend to rush/contact B therefore having 3 B on pistol round is standard, as well as 1 jiggle peeking mid and one playing retake on A(*CT/Triple or falling back to con from stairs*).
