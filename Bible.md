**N.B** This is entirely Work in progress, sections will be changed/removed/added in due course. I'm aiming to make this guide as good as possible so all feedback is appreciated. To start with the maps I will be featuring will be Mirage/Overpass/Inferno/Dust2 . This is because I can't play Nuke to a high level, I've never played ancient and have minimal games of vertigo, also the cover image/social media image of this guide is directly from the CSGO source code



**Feedback can be made by starting a [*New Issue*](https://github.com/AlfiePerkins1/CSGOBible/issues/new/choose) on the GitHub page or by messaging me on discord**

# Introduction

## Pre Thoughts

Throughout this guide i'll be discussing as much about Counter-Strike Global Offensive as possible, some ideas/theories will be directed to more specific skill levels. For this guide I will be using Beginner-Intermediate-Advanced. These levels will roughly correspond to a Competitive Level
- Beginner = Silver 1 - Gold Nova Master
- Intermediate = Master Guardian 1 - Legendary Eagle
- Advanced = Legendary Eagle Master - Global Elite

As well as this I will be paying attention to team based strats and calling which is suitable mainly for the Advanced category and above

<!--Maybe AdvancedPlus aswell-->


## What is CSGO

- Counter-Strike(CS) Global Offensive(CSGO) is the latest game in the Counter-Strike series produced by Valve it follows on from CS Source and before that CS 1.6

- It is a multiplayer first person shooter. In puts two teams(Terrorist & Counter Terrorist) against in each other in a variety of objective based game modes. 

- The game has an active e-sports scene with the latest major being [PGL Stockholm 2021 which was won by Na'Vi against G2 in a Bo3](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/PGL/2021/Stockholm) which received 2.7million peak viewers[^1]

  

  

## Game modes

- CSGO has 9 official gamemodes [Reference](https://www.metabomb.net/csgo/gameplay-guides/csgo-game-modes-guide "Reference"):


  - Competitive 
    - The mode played in proffesional CSGO, this the mode people first think of when thinking about CSGO as it is the gamemode that gives players ranks
    - This is the only mode that affects your Competitive rank
    - Two teams of 5 players in a MR30 (*maxround 30, I.E the first team to 16 rounds wins and the game is tied at 15-15*)
    - After 15 rounds (half way through), both teams switch side (T -> CT, CT -> T)
    - Each round lasts 1 minute 55 seconds, however this is reduced/increased to 40 seconds when the T's plant the bomb
    - In order for CT's to win the round they must either 
      1. Prevent the T's planting the bomb within the 1min55seconds
      2. Defuse the bomb after the T's have planted the bomb(*10seconds without a kit, 5 seconds with a kit*)
      3. Kill all T's before time expires
    - In order for the T's to win the round they must either
      1. Plant and exploded the bomb on either site(*A or B*)
      2. Kill all CT's before time expires
    - At the end of the game all players ranks in the game will become visible
    - All players must be Private Level 2 to play Competitive 
    - Friendly fire & collisions are enabled
    - Players can only spectate their teamates when they die


  - Casual
    - Similar to Competitive with minor changes
    - Team size becomes 10 player per team
    - Economy system changes in order to make a full buy possible each round to maximise play time
    - Collisions and friendly fire is disabled
    - The game ends after one team reaches 8 rounds
    - The number of grenades you can purchase is reduced 
    - Players can spectate **everyone** after they die
    - Casual games are losely based off your Competitive rank however not exactly


  - Deathmatch (DM)
    - Primary method of practicing & warming up (*other methods are more recommended, this will be discussed further on*) due to its high paced nature to help sharpen aiming skills
    - Can either be T or CT side, players can switch if a spot becomes available
    - Weapons are limited to their correct side (I.E AK on T side, M4 on CT side)
    - Each kill gives you points which moves you further up the in game leaderboard 
    - For a short period certain weapons grant bonus points, this is good for practicing with weapons you may rarely use. However it may lead to players using obselete weapons as well as weapons in incorrect scenarios
    - Respawns are quick and grant respawn immunity(can't be killed immediately as you spawn)
    - Spawns are in random locations spread across the map putting you into the action faster


  - Arms Race
    - Similar to Gun Game from Call of duty
    - Each player starts with a pistol and every 2 kills grants them an upgrade to a better gun 
    - The final stage is a golden knife, if the player reaches the golden knife and gets a kill with it they win the game
    - Quick respawns are enabled
    - The top players (Players who are closest to the golden knife) from each side glow through walls, adding an extra layer of difficulty 
    - Knifing someone (not with golden knife) will take them back to their previous gun
  - Wingman
    - Similar to competitive however its 2v2 making it ideal to play with a friend
    - Operates with the MR16 setup
    - Each round lasts 1min 30seconds meaning games don't become too long
    - Wingman ranks are seperate from competitive ranks
  - Retakes
    - 3 players on Terrorists(T) team, 4 on Counter Terrorists(CT) team
    - First team to 8 rounds wins the match
    - The round takes place with the bomb already planted
    - At the beginning of the round, each player picks a "loudout card" which decides what weapon and utility they get.
    - CT's spawn at set random locations surround the bombsite and T's spawn on the bombsite
    - The CT's get told which bombsite the bomb is planted at
    - Players cannot spectate enemey team when dead
    - Friendly fire and money is disabled
    - Weapons are not carried over if a player stays alive for a round
  - Flying Scoutsman

## Matchmaking Services

  - When you first attempt to gain a rank in CSGO you will be playing Valve's own Matchmaking system which pairs players of a similiar rank together, more information about ranking in the section below.

  - There is also third party matchmaking services which offer different benefits over valves standard matchmaking however often require a subscription. The main two services are faceit and ESEA

    <!-- 128 vs 64 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIGM6s-tJZE -->

  - Faceit:
    - Faceit is primarly played in EU 
    - Has Pro leagues for most countries which feed into "Faceit Pro League", this is where all the EU pros play
    - Can subscribe to hubs to allow you to play with only people in your region etc
    - Can use either the client or the web version. 
    - Uses ELO, the amount you get depends on average elo of your team and enemy team
    - Two identical teams will receive +25 elo for winning and -25 for losing
    - Infinite ranking system, the numerical system ends at Level 10 however your elo keeps increasing and you face players of similar elo

  - ESEA:
    - Primarly played in NA, however because they offer team leagues that is used across the world
    - Uses letter grades from D- to S+
    - Clear pathway from new teams to tier 1 teams
    - Open circuit tournements total $800,000 in prize money
    - Top European and North American teams qualify for ESL Pro League
    -

## Specs

- **N.B These specs were written when the game came out and are now very out of date, more modern recommendations are found below**

| Component | Minimum - Most likely won't even launch the game | Recommended - Use at own risk |
|---|---|---|
| CPU | Intel Core 2 Duo or E660 AMD Phenom X3 8750 | Intel Pentium Dual-Core E5700 3GHz or AMD Phenom 8750 Triple-Core |
| RAM | 2gb | 2gb |
| Storage | 40Gb HDD | 40gb SSD |
| GPU | 256mb & DirectX 9 compatible | NVIDIA GeForce GT 630 or AMD Radeon HD 6670 |
| Monitor | 720p 60Hz | 1080p 60Hz |

- Below is recommended specs by the community that *should* make you achieve the fps targets as shown

| Component | 150fps                               | 300fps+                                        |

*N.B these combinations are based on data from the community and may not get you the designated fps in practice and are from users on low settings*

## Video Settings

  - Unlike most games it is recommended to play CSGO on minimum settings in order to gain the most FPS possible
  - However shadows can be put on high to enable you to see enemies further away and from specific angles as well as use smoke lineups that rely on shadows
  - Multicore rendering should be enabled

## Resolution & Aspect Ratio

  - There are two schools of thoughts for CSGO aspect, either 16:9 or 4:3(*stretched or bb*)

  - What resolution & aspect ratio you chose should be a mix between what your PC can handle and personal preference

### Aspect Ratio
 - **16:9**

| Pros | Cons |
|---|---|
| Large FOV | Lower FPS |
|  | Smaller models |

   - Standard resolution used by most modern monitors

   - No out of the box changes required

   - Lower FPS compared to 4:3 
<br/><br/>
 - **4:3 Stretched**

| Pros | Cons |
|---|---|
| Higher FPS | Smaller FOV |
| Enemies appear bigger | Models move faster |
| | Requires additional setup |

   - 4:3 stretched is identical to 4:3 black bars except everything is stretched to fit the screen
<br/><br/>
 - **4:3 Black Bars(BB)**

| Pros | Cons |
|---|---|
| Higher FPS | Smaller FOV |
| Models don't move quicker | Same size models  |

   - 4:3 black bars is identical to 16:9 except with a portion of your screen cut off 
   - You have a smaller FOV however receive extra FPS compared to 16:9
   - This option is preffered by people who came from old CRT monitors or by those who find it easier to focus with black bars

- This image describes what different aspect ratios look like:
<img src="/Images/aspectratioimage.jpeg" width="1000" height="400" /> [^ 2]

### Resolution

- Each aspect ratio has a most popular resolution and then some alternatives

- **16:9 Resolution**
  - Most Popular: 1920 x 1080
  - Alternatives: 1280 x 720
    - Useful for lower end machines, FPS will be higher

- **4:3 Stretched & BB Resolutions**
  - Most Popular: 1280 x 960
  - Alternatives: 
    - 1024 x 768
      - Useful for lower end machines, FPS will be higher
    - 1440 x 1080
      - Lower FPS, however improved clarity (due to more pixels)
  

# Economy 

- The economy in CSGO is one of the most important aspects of the game, without good economical understanding you will be at a severe disadvantage. 
- As of 2021 each side starts with $800 at the beginning of each half and every player should always buy armour *unless in a team scenario but if you're reading this guide that's most likely not you*
- The maximum money one player can have is $16,000 
- The economy may be complicated at first however as with anything it becomes simpler with time and rarely needs to be tracked exactly

## Income

### Loss Bonus

- The losing team receives more money each round they lose in order to help them buy into the following rounds increase the chance of a comeback
- Each loss moves you up the ladder (1->2->3 etc), up to a max of 5 ($3400)
- Each win moves you down the ladder (5->4->3 etc), to a minimum of 0($0)

| Consecutive Loss | Money Received |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| 1                | $1400          |
| 2                | $1900          |
| 3                | $2400          |
| 4                | $2900          |
| 5                | $3400          |

[^4]

### Round  Win Income

| Event                 | Money Received        |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| **TERROISTS**         | **TERROISTS**         |
| Elimination Win       | $3250                 |
| Bomb detonation win   | $3500                 |
| **COUNTER TERROISTS** | **COUNTER TERROISTS** |
| Elimination Win       | $3250                 |
| Timeout win           | $3250                 |
| Bomb defuse win       | $3500                 |

### Event specific income

| Event                      | Money Received        |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **TERROISTS**              | **TERROISTS**         |
| Loss with bomb plant       | +$800                 |
| Bomb plant (individual)    | +$300                 |
| Time out loss (individual) | $0 (total)            |
| **COUNTER TERROISTS**      | **COUNTER TERROISTS** |
| Bomb defusal (individual)  | +$300                 |

### Weapon kill rewards

- Each type of weapon gives a different reward per kill 

| Weapon                 | Reward ($) |
| ---------------------- | ---------- |
| SMG (-P90)             | $600       |
| Shotgun                | $900       |
| AWP                    | $100       |
| Knife                  | $1500      |
| Any other weapon(+P90) | $300       |
| Team kill              | -$1500     |




## CT 

- Due to the nature of CSGO the CT's always tend to be in a worse economic situation than the T's due to the game favouring them when economy is even (T's have to push into the CT's)


### Pistol

- CT's start with $800 at the beginning of each half, typically you have 4/5 player purchase armour and 1 player purchasing a defuse kit. However most of the time 5 armoured CT's is much better.

### Eco

- Where nothing is bought in order to be able to buy next round (≈ 6000 for CT's)
- In certain circumstances one player may have more money that his team and can drop upgraded pistols, as long as he maintains his ability to full buy next round.

### Half Buy/Force

- This is where you buy either armour + upgraded pistol/SMG/Scout
- But you must always maintain the ability to buy fully next round (unless in a double eco[^ 5])

### Full buy

- Main Rifle: M4A1s/M4A4/AWP
- Secondary pistol if awping: (P250, 5-7, Deagle)
- Utility: Incendiary (situational), smoke, 2 flashes, grenade (situational)[^ Mirage],[^ Inferno],[^Overpass],[^Dust2] 
- Armour(if T's all have AK's *I.E Their full buy* then you don't need to buy a helmet as 1 ak headshot will instakill)

## T

### Pistol

- T's also start with $800 at the beginning of each half, at low level all T's should purchase armour to mitigate aim punch when hit by a USP in the body, however it's not uncommon for one person to buy utility + P250 in order to help with pistol execs.

### Eco

- Where nothing is bought in order to be able to buy next round (≈ $5500 for T's &)
- In certain circumstances one player may have more money that his team and can drop upgraded pistols, as long as he maintains his ability to full buy next round.

### Half Buy/Force

- This is where you buy either armour + upgraded pistol/SMG/Scout
- But you must always maintain the ability to buy fully next round (unless in a double eco[^ 5])
- However double eco's make less sense on T side due to the reduced cost of weapons and utility. This situation is only met where $0 income is received from previous round.

### Full buy

- Main Rifle: AK47/AWP
- Secondary pistol if awping: (P250, tec-9, Deagle)
- Utility: Incendiary, smoke, 2 flashes, grenade [^Utility]
- Full armour (Body + Head)

### Exceptions

[^5]: Double Eco: Where after losing a round players have $1500-1800, even if they eco they won't be able to full buy next round so they force buy (armour + pistol/ scout no armour) and then eco the next round and full buy on the third round.



# Tactics Beginner to Intermediate 

## T side strategies & setups

### Mirage

​	**Pistol**

  - Because glocks are better close range due to their increased movement accuracy and fire rate, it is better to burst out of a choke point and stay close range.
  - Example of these are:
    - Contact[^ 3] B 
    - Waterfall Palace
      - One player stands ramp and smokes CT & flashes high over palace, as the flash pops 4 players jump out from palace forcing their way onto site and plant the bomb with the cover of the CT smoke.   
    - Rush B with one player flashing over

​	**Force Buys**

​	**Gun Rounds**

[^Mirage]: NADE USAGE

### Overpass

​	**Pistol**

​	**Force Buys**

​	**Gun Rounds**

[^Overpass]: NADE USAGE

### Inferno

​	**Pistol**

  - Because glocks are better close range due to their increased movement accuracy and fire rate, it is better to burst out of a choke point and stay close range.
  - Example of these are:
    - Contact[^ 3] B 
    - Waterfall A appartments
      - T's make their way into appartments and stand on the left of the wall.    
    - Rush B with one player flashing over

​	**Force Buys**

​	**Gun Rounds**

[^Inferno]: NADE USAGE

### Dust 2

​	**Pistol**

​	**Force Buys**

​	**Gun Rounds**

[^Dust2]: NADE USAGE

## CT side strategies & setups

### Mirage

​	**Pistol**

  - Because Glocks are superior to the USP when up close and moving T's tend to rush/contact B therefore having 3 B on pistol round is standard, as well as 1 jiggle peeking mid and one playing retake on A(*CT/Triple or falling back to con from stairs*).

  - B site setup:

  - The aim is to stay as far away from the Glocks as possible, whilst playing headshot angles (*angles where only your head can be seen*)

  - Examples of good positions can be seen by the dots on the map of B site with the line of sight indicated by the red lines

[^Utility]: 

- Since only 4 pieces of utility can be held at one time the combination you buy is affected by a variety of factors:
  - Position playing
  - Role
  - Previous habits of the enemy team
  - Strat for current round
  - T/CT side

# Rotates

# Uninstalling

  - Arguably one of the biggest parts of CSGO is what you do when you lose a game:
    - 1. Navigate to your steam library
    - 2. Right click on CSGO
    - 3. Move your mouse over "manage"
    - 4. Click "Uninstall"
    - 5. And then click "uninstall again"
  - And then reinstall the next day
