# Economy 

- The economy in CSGO is one of the most important aspects of the game, without good economical understanding you will be at a severe disadvantage. 
- As of 2021 each side starts with $800 at the beginning of each half and every player should always buy armour *unless in a team scenario but if you're reading this guide that's not you*



## CT 

- Due to the nature of CSGO the CT's always tend to be in a worse economic situation than the T's due to the game favouring them on even economy

### 	Pistol

- CT's start with $800 at the beginning of each half, typically you have 4/5 player purchase armour and 1 player purchasing a defuse kit. However most of the time 5 armoured CT's is much better.

## T

### Pistol
